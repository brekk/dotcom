# katsu-curry

[Currying](https://fr.umio.us/favoring-curry/) is a technique for taking a function which expects multiple parameters into one which, when supplied with [fewer parameters](https://brekk.github.io/katsu-curry/docs/API.html#curry) (or potentially, [other expectations](https://brekk.github.io/katsu-curry/docs/API.html#curryObjectN)) returns a new function that awaits the remaining ones.

This library provides solutions for [traditional curry](https://brekk.github.io/katsu-curry/docs/API.html#curry), specifying a [number of keys for object-style curry](https://brekk.github.io/katsu-curry/docs/API.html#curryObjectK) (as originated by the [fpo](https://npmjs.org/package/fpo) module and [this book](https://leanpub.com/fljs)) as well as a (currently underwhelming in performance) [explicit-key object-style curry](https://brekk.github.io/katsu-curry/docs/API.html#curryObjectK).

Additionally, similarly to [other libraries](https://brekk.github.io/katsu-curry/#benchmark) in the space, this library provides a "placeholder" value which can be used to [omit a parameter](https://brekk.github.io/katsu-curry/docs/API-in-debug-mode.html) in partial-application.

## Features

* Traditional parameter currying:
  - `curry`
* Object-style currying:
  - `curryObjectK`
  - `curryObjectN`
  - `curryObjectKN`
* Partial application with any combination of arguments
  - `$` or `PLACEHOLDER`
* Utilities
  - for remapping parameters: `remap` and `remapArray`
  - for function composition: `pipe` and `compose`
  - for function constants: `K`
  - for functional identity: `I`
* An outrageously useful debug-modeâ„¢
  - add clarity when things aren't working (at the cost of speed)
  - `import debug from 'katsu-curry/debug'`
  - or `require('katsu-curry/debug')`
